          <h2>Custom Lobby Controller</h2>
          An alternative to the RBR custom lobby UI. <br><br>
          This application acts like an alternative UI to the Rocketbotroyale custom lobby screen. It can control lobbies from another device, and has a few custom features that RBR does not have. For security reasons (Hormaaa), we are releasing this as an executable EXE file for windows 10/11. We will try to make releases for both Mac and Linux, along with a browser-accesible web version. <br><br>
            Projected release date: Before 6/10/2024 (depends)<br><br>

  <span style='color:red'>Note: As gber (a mod) told me in no uncertain terms, the mods do not like this kind of stuff, so do not go yapping on the main Winterpixel Games server about this, though you can enlighten people to this project through dms and the such.</span>
