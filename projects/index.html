          <h2>Custom Lobby Controller</h2>
          An alternative to the RBR custom lobby UI. <br><br>
          This application acts like an alternative UI to the Rocketbotroyale custom lobby screen. It can control lobbies from another device, and has a few custom features that RBR does not have. For security reasons (Hormaaa), we are releasing this as an executable EXE file for windows 10/11. We will try to make releases for both Mac and Linux, along with a browser-accesible web version. <br><br>
            Projected release date: Before 6/10/2024 (depends)<br><br>

    <p>Note: If you cannot code, the projects below are basically useless to you. The links are to the source code, we do not write up instructions or check the projects below, so some of them might be broken. These are just to provide reference material and help get new projects going. If you are able to make something useful, please join our discord and tell us about it (ping <code>@Project Dev</code>)! We will most likely also link it here and add it as one of our projects</p>

  <span style='color:red'>Note: As gber (a mod) told me in no uncertain terms, the mods do not like this kind of stuff, so do not go yapping on the main Winterpixel Games server about this, though you can enlighten people to this project through dms and the such.</span>
